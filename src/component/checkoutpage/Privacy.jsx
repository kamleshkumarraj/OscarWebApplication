          VistaPrint reserves the right to charge fees for the Services or any
          portion thereof and any applicable fees will be posted on VistaPrint’s
          website. If Member is required to pay a fee for all or any part of the
          Service for which Member has chosen to subscribe, Member will make an
          advance payment for all applicable fees incurred by Member in
          connection with Member's Service Account. Member will be notified by a
          mail before end of his applicable subscription period that he needs to
          renew his subscription or else his account would be terminated, unless
          Member's Service Account is terminated in advance by the end of the
          then-current subscription period. All fees associated with Member's
          Service Account shall be paid in the currency referenced on the
          VistaPrint website at checkout. The exchange rate will be determined
          by VistaPrint through a reasonable source. The exchange rate
          determined by VistaPrint shall be undisputable.

          does not currently charge a fee) at any time and from time to time,
          provided, however, that VistaPrint will provide Member with reasonable
          notice prior to making any fee changes to existing Services. If Member
          finds any change to the pricing of any Services to be unacceptable for
          Member's continued use of the Services, Member is free to cancel such

          international, national, state or local, however designated, which are
          levied or imposed or may be levied or imposed, with respect to this

          attorney and collection fees, that Vistaprint may incur in its efforts
          to collect any remaining balances due from Member. This Section shall

        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mt-4">
          Member further acknowledges that Vistaprint will not be responsible
